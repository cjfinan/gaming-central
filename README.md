  ## Techonologies Used

  HTML5
  CSS3
  Balsamiq

  ## Issues / Bugs

  1) Using absolute paths for images or file paths.
      - GitPod uses relative paths rather than absolute

  2) Typos
     - When prood reading through the website typos were corrected

  3) Getting the slogan to apear underneath the logo
     - I intialy struggled to get the slogan to apear undearneath the logo but got around it by wrapping the slogan in a div so it was easier to position

## Unresolved

Improvement of performance - even with compressed versions of my images they are still making the site a little slower to load. Lighthouse recomends saving image files in webP aswell as using the correct size images.
